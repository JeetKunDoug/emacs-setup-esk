= Jim Weirich's Emacs Setup

This is my emacs setup.  It is currently based on the Emacs Starter
Kit by Technomancy. (https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit)

== Emacs Version

I'm using Emacs 23.3 from here: http://emacsformacosx.com/

(The Carbon Emacs package from
http://homepage.mac.com/zenitani/emacs-e.html is a bit older and the
starter kit is not compatibile with it, or so I've been told)

== Installing

(in progress)

* Install the Emacs Starter Kit listed above
* Clone this repository to .emacs.d/XXX (where XXX is your user name)

== Features

TBD
